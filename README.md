This repository contains two folders produced during development:

- `course/` - contains course-related notebooks and a minimal Python runner.
- `project/` - contains project-related notebooks and a minimal Python runner.

Quick start

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies from the `pyproject.toml` files in the subfolders if needed.
3. Run `python main.py` in either subfolder to run the example scripts.

If you want, I can also create a remote GitHub repo and push the initial commit â€” tell me whether you have a remote URL or want me to create the repo for you.
